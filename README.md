Hi, I’m Kris (@Kstengy). I live in Chicago with my wife and dog and spend my free time playing hockey, collecting whiskey and thinking about where I want to travel to next.
When I'm not enjoying my free time I earn a living by being a software engineer. I originally got a degree in International Business and German from Central Michigan University
but after several years of sales I decided to make a career change and explore the world of coding!

I’m currently learning:
- Spanish
- React Native
